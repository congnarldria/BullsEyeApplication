The BT Config Menu is made to allow users to swap between different BT bits without needing to update the log files manually. It also allows the user to connect and disconnect to the BT bits and check if they are responding. 

Known Bugs: Streaming function will bug out if used more than twice. Resetting the BT bit using DISCONNECT DEVICE then CONNECT DEFAULT will resolve the issue.
